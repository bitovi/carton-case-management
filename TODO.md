outstanding things to setup in this project:

- should we use tanstack query integration for trpc? -> yes!
- proper tprc testing setup in client/ -> do after integration with tanstack query
- ~~setup e2e tests -> just hangs for some reason~~ works, but not in devcontainer. need extra deps in devcontainer (dockerfile)
- ~~devcontainer build/startup is not working~~ i think this is now working properly
- ~~haven't tested storybook yet (should it run in devcontainer as well? -> expose port)~~

As a user, I want the ability to upvote a comment. This is done by clicking on the upvote icon.

As a user, I want to see which comments have been upvoted. I can tell which comments I've liked because when I look at the icon, the icon is highlighted for me based on my choice.

As a user, I want to see a list of users that has upvoted that comment by hovering on the related icon.

As a user, when there are upvotes, a number should display next to the icon. If there isn't any upvotes, no number should show, just the icon.

All the requirements for upvoting should exist for downvoting as well.
